# Thumbnail-Downloader
A website built on PHP,CSS,JavaScript to help the user download the thumbnail in jpg format just from a link

A demo is in the following link.

This is how the website would look but since Github does not allow the downloading option ,we cannot download the thumbnails from the link being hosted on Github.
